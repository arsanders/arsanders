# H1 Hello! My name is Abigail Sanders
## H2 About Me:
I am a third-year undergraduate student at **UCLA** studying Human Biology and Society as well as Bioinformatics. I am interested in studying genetic markers, such as DNA methylation, as predictors of disease. Currently, I am learning to develop models and applications to analyze epigenetic predictors of health.
