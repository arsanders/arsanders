# Hello! My name is Abigail Sanders
## About Me:
I am a **UCLA** graduate with a degree in Human Biology and Society as well as a minor in Bioinformatics. I am skilled in analyzing and extracting valuable insights from high-dimensional data. I hope to work on projects where I can use data's insights to create purposeful change for individuals. 

I have experience developing models and applications to analyze epigenetic predictors of health. My research was published in Frontiers in Psychology in December 2022 (DOI: 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1025494). In my PIC 10C course I completed complex programming projects in C++. I have also learned machine learning and data science methods in CS148.
